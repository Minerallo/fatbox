# Fault Analysis Toolbox for Spherical 3D Models

![Alt text](banner_spherical.jpg?raw=true "Fatbox for 3D spherical")


An adaptation of Fatbox for spherical 3D geometry. The scripts read the solution surface from ASPECT and skeletonize the plate boundaries and their networks using various fields such as strain rate and topography.
